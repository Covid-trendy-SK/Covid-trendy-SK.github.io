## What is this?

This is an interactive graph / animation that charts the trajectory of COVID-19 in districts of Slovak Republic.

The graph plots the number of new confirmed cases in the past week, versus the total number of confirmed cases.

When plotted in this way, exponential growth is displayed as a straight line.

**Tips:** Press Space (or the play button) to Play/Pause. Press +/- keys (or the slider) to see daily changes. Hover over the graph for more info. Drag cursor to zoom into graph, double-click to zoom back out. Use dropdown menus to switch between Confirmed Cases ↔ Deaths, between regions, or between a logarithmic ↔ linear scale. And don't forget to wash your hands!
